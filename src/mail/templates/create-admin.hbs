  To access the admin panel, append
  <code>/admin</code>
  to the homepage URL.
</p>

<p>The development team intentionally left out any buttons or links to the admin
  panel from the regular user interface.
  <br />
  Please note: once you access the panel, your session will remain active until
  it ends â€” this is for security reasons.
